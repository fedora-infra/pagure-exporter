        appears that since a few weeks ago, koschei stops being able to resolve dependencies
        for packages in some circumstances, and never recovers. In this state, koschei
        does not schedule any new scratch builds for the affected packages, and does
        not report new issues about unresolved dependencies (because dependency resolution
        for the affected packages is apparently stuck). This makes koschei useless
        for packages that are affected by this issue - and it appears to be affecting
        more and more packages over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also filed a ticket with koschei

        .\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are adding a Flatpak test to openQA. One thing the test does
        is check that installing flatpaks from Flathub works OK - which involves downloading
        several hundred megabytes from Flathub, because each time the test runs, it's
        on a fresh system which doesn't have any base flatpaks yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe
        have the all-clear from Flathub folks to run this for compose testing (i.e.
        a couple of times per day on average), but we'd ideally like to run it on
        updates too, which would involve running it a lot more than a couple of times
        a day. The flathub folks suggested that setting up a reverse proxy for flathub
        (as someone wrote up [here](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2023-04-05-lan-cache-flatpak.html))
        would be a good idea in that case, so I'm filing this ticket to see if we
        can have an infra-level reverse proxy. (Possibly this is even already covered
        by something existing? I'm not sure.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's no firm date on this,

        can be ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four \\\"changes\\\" in this system wide
        change:\\r\\n\\r\\n * Stop generating metadata in sqlite database format by
        default\\r\\n\\r\\nSqlite was an addon to the original format, was an optimization,
        and everything looking at repodata copes with it not being there (lots of
        repos didn't produce it).\\r\\n\\r\\n * We propose to include just one variant
        of groups.xml using specified compression\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a minor compatibility
        problem, if you don't need group data you won't even notice and I think even
        rhel-7 yum can be configured to ignore group data (not checked). Obvious workaround
        is to pretend groupdata is empty and/or use the compressed one (the big problem
        being if you don't have zstd support).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does breaks the original
        format, so it is worth letting people know ... but lots of workarounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n
        * increase major version above 0\\r\\n\\r\\nI doubt anyone would notice.\\r\\n\\r\\n
        * Switch default compression from gz to zstd.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreaks the format
        and probably breaks any non-DNF repodata code. Very hard to workaround if
        you don't have zstd decompression access (no python-zstandard in rhel8, but
        it's in epel8 ... and it's not even in epel7).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn first reading
        I would have assumed this was backwards compatible by adding primary_zstd/etc.
        fields ... you do mention it breaks everything in the compatibility section,

        Describe what you would like us to do:\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a pending backlog
        of issues and pull requests to the [asknot-ng](https://github.com/fedora-infra/asknot-ng)
        project on GitHub. I am requesting owner/maintainer rights of this repository
        to my GitHub account, [jwflory](https://github.com/jwflory/). I am already
        a member of the fedora-infra GitHub organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand
        WCIFF is targeted for decommission due to no maintainers and a tech stack
        that the Fedora Infra team does not actively use. However, I still strongly
        believe that the function of this application has immense value. It is one
        that regular appears in the mindshare part of Fedora. I am not sure we ever
        perfected a workflow of community contribution around this tool. But I want
        to help change that.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoals for my request could be as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.
        Review the current stack, update dependencies, get it running in a container
        with the latest version of Fedora.\\r\\n2. See if the current deployment pipeline
        is salvageable or if we need to devise a new way to deploy the application.\\r\\n
        \   * **If salvageable**: Fix any easyfix bugs and get a new version deployed
        with some recent community changes.\\r\\n    * **If a new way is needed**:
        Could explore using a static site generator like Hugo to recreate the app
        in a lighter-weight framework.\\r\\n3. Review backlog of pull requests from
        community. Merge where applicable, reject if they are too stale.\\r\\n4. Once
        the backlog is cleared, audit the current contribution process.\\r\\n    *
        See how the contribution guidelines are currently documented. Understand contributor
        journey.\\r\\n    * Make improvements based on the reflection on the contribution
        guidelines.\\r\\n5. Migrate project to GitLab to join other Fedora mindshare
        teams and be closer to the Websites & Apps Team on GitLab.\\r\\n\\r\\n# When
        do you need this to be done by? (2023-11-22)\\r\\n\\r\\nNot urgent and I do
        not expect to start right away.\", \n      \"custom_fields\": [], \n      \"date_created\":

        We have an issue with accessing fedora SMTP server from the new provider's
        cluster where cfp.fedoraproject.org is running as this provider is blocking
        port 25 for outgoing communication. Would it be possible to open port 587
        for SMTP as well? Until that users are affected by ERROR 504 (will be handled
        in CfP) and the email communication is blocked. See report below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis
        issue is present at CFP for the creative freedom summit site (cfp.fedoraproject.org).\\r\\nWhen
        people submit a talk , it end with a 504, gateway timeout. The talk is properly
        submitted, but there is no user feedback, which is not great (will be handled
        separately).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is caused by sending mail after a submissison.
        I checked the DB, and the smtp server for that specific CFP is the fedora
        one, on port 25. And that's blocked by the firewall.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the pod,
        it can't connect to smtp-auth-cc-rdu01.fedoraproject.org port 25:\\r\\n\\r\\nbash-4.4$
        cat < /dev/tcp/8.43.85.71/22\\r\\nSSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.0\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a
        response, so the port is open (and my magic bash command work)\\r\\n\\r\\nPort
        25, same server ( smtp-auth-cc-rdu01.fedoraproject.org is 8.43.85.71 ):\\r\\nbash-4.4$
        cat < /dev/tcp/8.43.85.71/25\\r\\n        \\r\\nThere is no response, so the
        port is not reachable.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a server without a outgoing firewall,
        it display the right prompt immediately\\r\\n\\r\\n$  cat < /dev/tcp/8.43.85.71/25\\r\\n220
        smtp-auth-cc-rdu01.fedoraproject.org ESMTP Postfix\\r\\n\\r\\nI checked the
        DB, all others smtp providers configured use SMTP port 587, which is made
        specifically to send mail with authentication (so not blocked in the name
        of spam filtering by a ton of people). This one use port 25, and there is
        no port 587 opened on the server and this is not configured on the mail server
        side, so we can't just switch right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom here, there is multiple
        solutions:\\r\\n\\r\\n- convince Fedora to open port 587 and configure their
        server to use it.\\r\\n- use another smtp provider. I see that gmail, mailchimp
        and mimecast were configured for others conferences. They all use port 587,
        that shouldn't be blocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think solution 2 is the easiest, but
        that requires to discuss with Fedora folks first as they might have specific
        requirements regarding their mail domain. If the conference is attached to
        using only free software, we (OSPO) can provides a alternative to the aforementioned
        providers (who are arguably not free software), as we have the same setup
        as Fedora in the same location (and even maybe on server sitting next to each
        others), except port 587 is opened and usable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolution 1 depend
        on Fedora's infra team willingness to do some changes in their playbooks.
        I took a look yesterday night, and that's not a trivial task, as that part
        of the configuration would requires a bit of re-factoring and is a bit messy
        and also critical. However, i think that's the best solution longer term (but
        then, it might turn in a longer initiative, and that's not going to help for
        getting a quick fix)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\", \n      \"custom_fields\": [], \n

        We did do a update/reboot cycle yesterday of all hosts, including builders.\\r\\n\\r\\nHm,
        the build succeeded on Monday, before the update/reboot.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Note
        that \\\"free\\\" there is what should better be called 'wasted'. ie, its
        not being used at all. You can see cache/buffers is 15GB, so if more memory

        failing on ppc64le?\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, builds for all architectures have been
        reliable since January, when you fixed #11000. (Looking through my old infrastructure
        tickets, I think our build infrastructure has been good for WebKitGTK with
        the exception of basically all of 2022, which seemed like a struggle. My other
        recentish issue was #10544.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI also had three other equivalent
        builds for ppc64le succeed without difficulty a day or two prior to this failed
        one. However, this particular build appears to have restarted six times, so
        this was not a transient issue and is likely to reoccur. I suspect not enough
        RAM; maybe the logic to drop caches did not operate quickly enough? RAM use
        can go from low to extremely high in a very short amount of time.\\r\\n\\r\\n>Are
        the items that @kalev put in for debuginfo generation still being used? (although
        I guess this is f37 and might be before those were added)?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was
        in place but likely ineffective. We have:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n# Require 32
        GB of RAM per vCPU for debuginfo processing. 16 GB is not enough.\\r\\n%global
        _find_debuginfo_opts %limit_build -m 32768\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nto request
        32 GB of RAM per vCPU during debuginfo processing. This is the most memory-intensive
        part of the build so it's where problems are most likely to occur. But all
        this can do is limit parallelism to 1 job; if there's not enough RAM for 1
        job, it's still going to fail.\\r\\n\\r\\n(We also have `%cmake_build %limit_build
        -m 3072` to request 3 GB of RAM per vCPU during compilation, but failures
        here are less likely. Since koji doesn't offer build logs for the restarted
        builds, I can't know for sure where it failed.)\", \n          \"date_created\":

        https://matrix.to/#/#sigs:fedora.im\\r\\n\\r\\nMy justification is for two
        reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Onboarding: Most often, I am helping a team get set
        up on Matrix and my use case is that I want to add a room to an existing space.
        However, I do not have permissions to do so in many spaces. Setting the admin
        bit on my role account (i.e. `@fca:fedoraproject.org`) makes this easier to
        do and also to sustainably hand off to a future successor.\\r\\n1. Maintenance
        and moderation: A few unscrupulous cases happened in our busiest rooms where
        we needed moderation, fast. I would like the admin bit across a space so that
        I can help intervene in the most severe cases, even if I am not a room moderator.
        Also, generally, I am trying to spend more time on the Matrix end of things
        so I can help organize a team or SIG around Matrix in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n#
        When do you need this to be done by? (YYYY/MM/DD)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis contributes
        to #11605. Sooner is better than later. The SIGs space is most important to

        a *temporary* (307) redirect from start.fp.o to fp.o/start.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm
        requesting that a temporary redirect be used (at first) just in case we discover
        that the new start page does not scale well. It performs many API queries
        to discussion.fp.o each time a user loads the page. Depending on how discussion.fp.o
        caches those queries, this may or may not work well. So I don't want to burn
        any bridges. My hope is that if we find a problem with the new page, we should
        be able to switch back to the old one (307 redirects should not be cached
        by the end user's browser). After a time, if everything seems to be working
        OK, we can switch to a permanent (308) redirect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated
